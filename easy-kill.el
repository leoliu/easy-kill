;;; Commentary:

;; `easy-kill' aims to be a drop-in replacement for `kill-ring-save'.
;;
;; To use: (global-set-key [remap kill-ring-save] 'easy-kill)

;; `easy-mark' is similar to `easy-kill' but marks the region
;; immediately.
;;
;; `easy-mark-sexp' can be a handy replacement for `mark-sexp' which
;; allows you to use +,=/- to do list-wise expanding/shrinking.
;;
;; To use: (global-set-key [remap mark-sexp] 'easy-mark-sexp)
